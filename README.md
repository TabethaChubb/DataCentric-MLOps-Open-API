## Additional Considerations

- **Versioning:**  
  Implement API versioning (e.g., `/v1/data/datasets`) to ensure backward compatibility.

- **Pagination & Filtering:**  
  Use query parameters for pagination, sorting, and filtering on list endpoints (e.g., `/data/datasets?sort=name&limit=50`).

- **Error Handling:**  
  Provide consistent error responses (JSON with error code, message, and details).

- **Security:**  
  Secure endpoints with authentication (e.g., OAuth2/JWT) and HTTPS to protect sensitive data and operations.
